quick script to crunch hashes for xkcd 'Externalities' (http://xkcd.com/1193)

check the standings at http://almamater.xkcd.com/best.csv

This script is very rough currently; I invite improvements and pull requests. (A
hash checker implemented on the GPU would be a dramatic improvement)

dependencies:
  python3
    try changing the first line to #!/usr/bin/python3 if there are problems
  pyskein (http://pythonhosted.org/pyskein/download.html)
    to compute the skein hashes
  requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
    currently used to screenscrape the target hash and to submit new bests
  standard python libraries
